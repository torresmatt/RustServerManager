# RustServerManager
Just a command line tool to work with Rust Dedicated Servers.

I'd like to have it where someone can run the program, manage individual servers int he command line, updated them, wipe them, etc.


I don't expect much interest in it, it's just something for me to use to learn to do various things (object serialization, etc).
